Acquiring data from a Davis Vantage weather station using the pyvantagepro software. Only tested with the Vantage Pro 2 combined with a Davis WeatherLink 6510SER serial port data logger (connected via a ser2usb converter to the ha server). Probably works with the WeatherLink 6510USB as well. Other models unsure. Please leave a note if model is working.

### The following models should work:

- Wizard III
- Wizard II
- Monitor
- Perception
- GroWeather
- Energy Environmonitor
- Health Environmonitor
- Vantage Pro
- Vantage Pro 2 (Rev B)
- Weather Envoy
- Vantage Vue
